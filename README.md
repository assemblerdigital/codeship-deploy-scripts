# codeship-deploy-scripts
This is a series of deployment scripts I use to deploy Drupal and Wordpress sites to my hosting environment using Codeship's "custom script" deployment feature. They're a bit environment specific, but they should give you a decent enough starting place. Please note: these are a WIP, and being constantly updated as my requirements change!
